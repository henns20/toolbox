1. what is included with angular 2 cli
- what do you need besides the base code(in general & angular 2 development)
    * generators(?) (from my mind can scaffold out, generate an application like yeoman)
    * karma test runner
    * server with live reload
    * linter
    * typescript compiler
    * deploy to github
