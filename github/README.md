###  ??
- Underscore or dash in Git branch names?
    * quasi-pole from a san francisco engineer*: https://twitter.com/kvnsmth/status/409026393755090945
    * dash seem to be the overwhelming choice

- Atom & Git Integration
    * http://blog.atom.io/2014/03/13/git-integration.html
    * Atom displays branch(currently working on)
        * lower right-hand corner area

__Streamlining github pages into your development process__
  * [option 0: gulp-github-pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-gh-pages)
  * [option 1: using git tech only](https://gist.github.com/cobyism/4730490)
    * also includes a way to automate with a shell command(& gulp)
  * [option 2: using a third-party script](https://github.com/X1011/git-directory-deploy )
    * advantages: do not have to maintain build/dist in your master branch
    * disadvantages: uses tech beyond git(maintainability)
    *

__My process regarding option 1__

- git ghp-deploy build
- git shell command location: /usr/local/bin
    - file: git-ghp-deploy
