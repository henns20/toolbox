(below is a first go/draft)

## My Top(Some/Current) tips, tricks, etc.
- **Using `shicks`**: alternative technique similar use case to `selrang`. Place your mouse pointer to any position above or below the cursor. Saying `shicks` will highlight everything in between.
- **Shoff O Commando(atom)**: Keep the commando directory open/available during the day. Especially when ramping up so you can make additions on the fly.
- **Favorite Command `creek`**: it never seems to fail. Knock on wood : -)
- **Still slow after `restart dragon`**: restart voicecode, growl, dragon. Don't feel the need to reboot your computer.
- **Dragtrain sparingly**: enough said : -)


## My Condition

__Currently__: (as of 07/16)
- persistent swollen/inflamed [PIP joints](http://proactive4pt.com/pt/wp-content/uploads/finger_swanneck_cause01-300x300.jpg) on the palm side
- affects both hands, but more on the right(maybe mouse related)
- some DIP discomfort/inflammation
- general hot feeling or pain if overuse the hands - worse in the right hand
- as of July, using voicecode, smartnav & foot pedal for 90% of my computer activity
- typing or using mouse for any length of time persists information/pain


__Some Background__:

* __Part 1__: Around the end of 01/2015 after a period of time of long hours of typing/coding on a Macbook Pro Aluminum & standard wireless mouse, I developed inflammation/pain in PIP/DIP joints. Icing & taping my finger joints was my first approach. Got a Kinesis Freestyle 2 & trackball mouse which helped, but later came back after increased hours with mousing & typing. _By 10/2016 I could no longer touch the keyboard without severe pain_. After a lot of research & effort with other things(Native Mac dictation, Macros web storm, and more), I stumbled upon the dragonfly project(via [Tavis Rudd's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SkdfdXWYaI)) and then I found Voicecode.

* __Part 2__: After about 1-2 months off the keyboard &/or using pencils &/or using other dictation methods, I bought & began to start ramping up with Voicecode I started to type/mouse for at least 25-50% of the time. It got worse, or at the very least remain the same. As of 06/2016, 1) I worked with Voicecode for as much as I can with the hope of promoting optimized healing. 2) I completely cut out the mouse,  trackpad, touchscreen activities. Try only to use smartnav & foot pedal  I began acupuncture about 3/4(07/2016) weeks ago.I've definitely noticed the difference or scene physical improvements/healing. Cautiously optimistic to be able to divide voicecode/hands-on coding 50/50. But it has been a long/frustrating road. That said, I am happy & grateful for Voicecode and the community surrounding it. : -)
