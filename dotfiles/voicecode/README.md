## My Condition

__Currently__: (as of 05/16)
- persistent swollen/inflamed [PIP joints](http://proactive4pt.com/pt/wp-content/uploads/finger_swanneck_cause01-300x300.jpg) on the palm side
- affects both hands, but more on the right(maybe mouse related)
- some DIP discomfort/inflammation
- using voicecode & smartnav 90% for my computer activity
- typing or using mouse for any length of time persists information/pain


__Some Background__: Around 01/15 after a period of time of long hours of typing/coding on a Macbook Pro Aluminum, developed inflammation/pain in PIP joints. Got a Kinesis Freestyle 2 which helped, but later came back after increased hours with mouse & typing.
