# My Voicecode Profile

[My Cheat sheet I used starting out](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-QJJSWx0MR6vZzY0a8lXDg7ZJPv-h2H7i0lD6sLiIY4/edit?usp=sharing)

(below is a first go/draft)

## My Top(Current) 3 to 5 tips, tricks, etc.
- **Using `shicks`**: alternative technique similar use case to `selrang`. Place your mouse pointer to any position above or below the cursor. Saying `shicks` will highlight everything in between.
- **Shoff O Commando(atom)**: Keep the commando directory open/available during the day. Especially when ramping up so you can make additions on the fly.
- **Favorite Command `creek`**: it never seems to fail. Knock on wood : -)


## My Condition

__Currently__: (as of 05/16)
- persistent swollen/inflamed [PIP joints](http://proactive4pt.com/pt/wp-content/uploads/finger_swanneck_cause01-300x300.jpg) on the palm side
- affects both hands, but more on the right(maybe mouse related)
- some DIP discomfort/inflammation
- using voicecode, smartnav & foot pedal for 90% of my computer activity
- typing or using mouse for any length of time persists information/pain


__Some Background__: Around 01/15 after a period of time of long hours of typing/coding on a Macbook Pro Aluminum, I developed inflammation/pain in PIP joints. Icing & taping my finger joints was my first approach. Got a Kinesis Freestyle 2 which helped, but later came back after increased hours with mousing & typing. After a lot of research & effort with other things(Native Mac dictation, Macros web storm, and more), I stumbled upon the dragonfly project(via Tavis Rud d's video) and then I found Voicecode. While ramping up with voicecode I continued to type/mouse for at least 50% of the time. It got worse. As of this month, I'm working with Voicecode for as much as I can with the hope of healing. I am scheduled to get tested for rheumatoid arthritis and/or other chronic conditions. Hoping for the best, but in the meantime I am happy I found Voicecode and the community surrounding it. : -)
